## Narrative: 2018-07-06_nbk1-1cpu-1core

**Objective**: obtain data on `nbk1` with only one core/tread available
at the guest OS level for Hercules.
To be compared with [2018-07-06_nbk1-1cpu-2core](2018-07-06_nbk1-1cpu-2core.md).

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is excellent, the median of the 50% width is 0.48%.
- **Instruction timing relative to 2core system**
  - the `1core` system is a **factor 1.019 slower**
    than the `2core` system,
    based on the [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of
    112.05 to 114.15.
  - the 1core/2core instruction time ratio has a very small spread, see
    [1core vs 2core](#user-content-find-vs-2core)
    timing comparison.

#### <a id="find-vs-2core">1core vs 2core timing comparison</a>

The [1core](2018-07-06_nbk1-1cpu-1core.md) and the
[2core](2018-07-06_nbk1-1cpu-2core.md) datasets differ only the the number
of host system cores made available for the guest OS which executes
Hercules.

The [1core vs 2core](sum_2018-07-06_nbk1-1cpu-2core_and_1core.dat) instruction
timing listing shows the absolute instruction times for 2core and 1core as well
as the 1core/2core ratio, sorted by ascending 1core/2core ratio.

The 1core/2core instruction time ratio has a very small spread.
The most likely explanation is that all Hercules threads compete now for
only one host system core. As result, the Hercules service threads will
divert host CPU time from the Hercules thread which emulates the s/370 CPU,
which must lead to a reduced effective CPU speed seen at the MVS level.
This is also seen in a slightly increased CPU time for the ASM step
```
  1core:  CPU:   2.83s   0.71%;   CPU/ela:  92.48%
  2core:  CPU:   2.74s   2.92%;   CPU/ela:  92.26%
```

Only the `STCK` timing differs significantly.
```
Tag   Comment                :     2core     1core :    ratio
T600  STCK m                 :    161.41    123.18 :    0.763
```

Both datasets use the same OS and the same kernel. A possible explanation
could be that the access to the CPU timers has less overhead in a single
core system.

A very similar behaviour was also observed in a _1 core vs 2 core_
comparison for two `Intel Atom 330` systems, see
[pra1 vs pra2](2018-06-26_pra1.md#user-content-find-vs-pra2).
