## System Info: P/390

The P/390 system is a
[PC-based IBM-compatible mainframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-based_IBM-compatible_mainframes) composed of a
[Pentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5_(microarchitecture)) based PC,
running [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2), and a
[PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI)
expansion card which carries the P/390 CPU plus memory.
The CPU is implemented as single ASIC with the key features
- 0.6 micron CMOS gate array technology
- 70.125 MHz clock, divided into a four-phase clock
- 212K gates complexity
- 32 kB loadable control store
- horizontal microcode with 136 bits per word
- internal data path is 64 bits wide
- full ESA/390 instruction set
- hardware floating point internal to processor
- I/O handled via PCI by host system (OS/2)
