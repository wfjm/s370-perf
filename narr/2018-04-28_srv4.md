## Narrative: 2018-04-28_srv4

**Objective**: obtain data on an `Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4` based system.
To be compared with [2018-03-31_sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md),
[2018-04-29_srv3](2018-04-29_srv3.md) and
[2018-04-27_srv5-a](2018-04-27_srv5-a.md).

**Proviso**: the benchmark was the only user process on the server. On a fully
loaded system execution speed will be lower because CPU clock will be adjusted
to keep the total power consumption in the
[TDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power) limit.
This test gives therefore the **single core peak performance**.

### Findings <a name="find"></a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is moderate, the median of the 50% width is 3.54%,
    see section [time variation](#user-content-find-tvar).
- **Instruction timing relative to sys2 reference system**
  - the `Xeon E5-2680 v4` based [srv4](hostinfo_srv4.md)  system is a
    **factor of 1.09 faster** than the `Xeon E5-1620` based
    [sys2](hostinfo_sys2.md) reference system, based on the
    [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of 124.15 to 113.95.
  - the sys2/srv4 instruction time ratio has a modest spread, see
    [sys2 vs srv4 timing comparison](#user-content-find-vs-sys2).
- **Instruction timing relative to srv3 system**
  - the `Xeon E5-2680 v4` based [srv4](hostinfo_srv4.md)  system is a
    **factor of 1.07 faster** than the `Xeon E5-2660 v3` based
    [srv3](hostinfo_srv3.md) system, based on the
    [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of 124.15 to 116.22.
  - the srv3/srv4 instruction time ratio has a very modest spread, see
    [srv3 vs srv4 timing comparison](#user-content-find-vs-srv3).

#### time variation <a name="find-tvar"></a>
The w50 width of time distributions is with 3.54% larger than on most other
tested systems. The test was done on an exclusively used server, no other user
processes ran in parallel. Even the system background load caused apparently
an occasional throttling of the CPU clock, leading to the observed width.

#### sys2 vs srv4 timing comparison <a name="find-vs-sys2"></a>
The [sys2 vs srv4](sum_2018-04-28_srv4_and_sys2.dat) instruction
timing listing shows the absolute instruction times for srv4 and sys2
as well as the sys2/srv4 ratio, sorted by ascending ratio.

`CS`, `CDS` and `TS` are faster on sys2 because the kernel didn't have
Meltdown patches (yet). The remaining instructions don't show any clear
trend or systematic.

#### srv3 vs srv4 timing comparison <a name="find-vs-srv3"></a>
The [srv3 vs srv4](sum_2018-04-29_srv4_and_srv3.dat) instruction
timing listing shows the absolute instruction times for srv4 and srv3
as well as the srv3/srv4 ratio, sorted by ascending ratio.

The instruction times agree at the +- 10% level.
This is not a surprise, because the two CPUs have very closely related
microarchitectures

| System | CPU | Microarchitecture | Technology |
| ------ | --- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| srv3   | Xeon E5-2660 v3 | [Haswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture))   | 22 nm; launched Q3'14 |
| srv4   | Xeon E5-2680 v4 | [Broadwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadwell_(microarchitecture)) | 14 nm; launched Q1'16 |

`Haswell` is a shrink of the `Broadwell` microarchitecture, a `tick`
in the Intel
[tick-tock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick%E2%80%93tock_model) model,
that's why the overall behavior is very similar.
