## Narrative: 2018-04-18_sys2

**Objective**: retest [sys2](hostinfo_sys2.md) after OS and kernel upgrade.
To be compared with [2018-03-31_sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md).

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
The host system was upgraded from Debian 7 (Wheezy) to Debian 8 (Stretch),
the kernel changed from 3.2.0 to 3.16.0.

The test reproducibility is now much worse, the median of the 50% width is
now 6.12% compared to 0.89% before.
The [cpufreq](README_narr.md#user-content-cpufreq) configuration changed,
now 'powersave' instead of 'ondemand' before, but it is unclear whether
this caused the change in reproducibility.

The overall execution speed decreased by about 1.1%, deduced from the
[lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) evolution, 115.88 to
114.56 MIPS. The essential part of the
[sys2 update](sum_2020-04-18_sys2.dat) summary is

```

Significant changes are seen for instructions involving system calls
- `STCK` is now significantly slower. 
- `CS`, `CDS` and `TS` are about a factor two slower. These three
  instructions invoke the `sched_yield()` system call and are therefore
  most dependent on the OS layer.
