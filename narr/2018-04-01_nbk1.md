## Narrative: 2018-04-01_nbk1

**Objective**: obtain data on an `Intel Core i7-3520M` based system.
To be compared with [2018-03-31_sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md).

### Findings <a name="find"></a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is very good, the median of the 50% width is 0.64%.
- **Instruction timing relative to sys2 reference system**
  - the `Intel Core i7-3520M` based [nbk1](hostinfo_nbk1.md) has a
    **very similar performance** than the `Xeon E5-1620` based
    [sys2](hostinfo_sys2.md) reference system, based on the
    [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of 113.46 to 115.88.
  - the nbk1/sys2 instruction time ratio has a very modest spread, see
    [nbk1 vs sys2 timing comparison](#user-content-find-vs-sys2).

#### nbk1 vs sys2 timing comparison <a name="find-vs-sys2"></a>
The [nbk1 vs sys2](sum_2018-04-01_sys2_and_nbk1.dat) instruction
timing listing shows the  absolute instruction times for sys2 and nbk1
as well as the nbk1/sys2 ratio, sorted by ascending ratio.

The instruction times with the exception of `STCK` agree at the +- 20% level.
This is not a surprise, because the mobile CPU `Core i7-3520M` and the
workstation CPU `Xeon E5-1620` have very closely related microarchitectures

| System | CPU | Microarchitecture | Technology |
| ------ | --- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| nbk1   | Core i7-3520M | [Ivy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture))   | 22 nm; launched Q2'12 |
| sys2   | Xeon E5-1620  | [Sandy Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge) | 32 nm; launched Q1'12 |

`Ivy Bridge` is a shrink of the `Sandy Bridge` microarchitecture, a `tick`
in the Intel
[tick-tock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick%E2%80%93tock_model) model,
that's why the overall behavior is very similar.

nbk1 uses Linux under VirtualBox on Windows, while sys2 uses a native
Linux system. The instructions involving system calls are sensitive to
this environment change
- The time for `STCK` differs by a factor 2.4, most likely due to
  additional overhead in `clock_gettime`.
- that `CS`,`CDS`, and `TS` show very similar timings is a surprise.
