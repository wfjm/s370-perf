## Narrative: 2018-06-26_pra1

**Objective**: obtain data on an `Intel Atom 330` based system with only one CPU enabled. 
To be compared with [2018-06-26_pra2](2018-06-26_pra2.md).

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is very good, the median of the 50% width is 0.92%.
- **Instruction timing relative to pra2 system**
  - the [pra1](hostinfo_pra1.md) and the [pra2](hostinfo_pra2.md) system use
    the Intel Atom 330 CPU.
    In `pra1` only a single core is enabled, while `pra2` uses the capacity of
    the CPU.
  - the [pra1](hostinfo_pra1.md) system is a **factor 1.066 slower**
    than the [pra2](hostinfo_pra2.md) system,
    based on the [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of
    19.35 to 20.63.
  - the pra1/pra2 instruction time ratio has a very small spread, see
    [pra1 vs pra2 timing comparison](sum_2018-06-26_pra2_and_pra1.dat).
  - only the `STCK` timing differs significantly. Both systems use the same OS
    and the same kernel. A possible explanation could be that the access to
    the CPU timers has less overhead in a single core system.
