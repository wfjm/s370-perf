### <a id="find">Findings</a>
The host system was converted from a Windows 7 with VirtualBox with
XUbuntu 18.04 LTS setup to a native KUbuntu 18.04 LTS installation. The
main change is that the VM layer is removed, while the Linux part
stayed essentially unchanged
- KUbuntu 18.04 LTS instead of XUbuntu 18.04 LTS
- kernel 4.15.0-91 instead of 4.15.0-23

The test reproducibility improved slightly, the median of the 50% width is
1.14%. The overall execution speed improved by about 2.7%, deduced from the
[lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) evolution, 78.17 with VM to
80.31 MIPS. The essential part of the
[nbk2 native vs vm](sum_2020-04-18_nbk2.dat) summary is

```

Significant changes are seen for instructions involving system calls
- `STCK` is now slightly faster. 
- `CS`, `CDS` and `TS` are about a factor three faster. These three
  instructions invoke the `sched_yield()` system call and are therefore
  most dependent on the OS layer.
  See  [blog entry](https://wfjm.github.io/blogs/mvs/2018-01-14-impact-of-meltdown-on-hercules.html) for some background. It is therefore not surprising that
  the elimination of the VM layer resulted in a substantial speedup of these
  three instructions.
