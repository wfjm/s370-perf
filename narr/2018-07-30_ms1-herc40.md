## Narrative: 2018-07-30_ms1-herc40

**Objective**: obtain reference data with the Hercules 4.0 emulator on an
`AMD A6-5200` based system. 
To be compared with [2018-07-30_ms1-sim390](2018-07-30_ms1-sim390.md).

**Note**: The operating system running on the emulator is
[MUSIC/SP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC/SP) and not MVS 3.8J as
for the majority of the `s370_perf` data. This difference should have no
sizeable impact on the measured instruction timings since `SVC` and
privileged instructions, which depend on system response times, aren't covered.

- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is poor, the median of the 50% width is 8.2%.
