## Narrative: 2017-11-30_p390

Very first data from a P/390 system produced with an early version of perf_asm
which was later renamed to s370_perf.

### Findings

A first analysis was done, using the nominal clock specification of a P/390
- clock frequency 70.125 MHz
- thus clock period 14.260 ns
- 4-phase clock
- thus distinguish major and sub clock cycles

The data shown in [2017-11-30_p390.dat](../data/2017-11-30_p390.dat) are
analyzed with these nominal clock values
```
s370_perf_ana  -cf 70.125  -cp 14.260  -cn 4  <input file>
```

It is natural to expect that simple instructions like `LR` or `LA` take
one major cycle, thus `n-cp` close to 4.00, `mcc`=1 and `scc`=0, but the
picture isn't that simple

```

The instructions seem to take a little longer than a major clock cycle,
`mcc` is 4.06 to 4.15 for the instructions listed above, and the factor
varies from instruction to instruction.

This prompted the development of additional tests, which finally ended up
under `T9**` in later s370_perf versions. With them the puzzle was resolved,
