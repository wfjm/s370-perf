## Narrative: 2018-04-29_srv3

**Objective**: obtain data on an `Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3` based system.
To be compared with [2018-04-20_srv2](2018-04-20_srv2.md) and
[2018-04-28_srv4](2018-04-28_srv4.md).

**Proviso**: the benchmark was run on an almost idle server. On a fully
loaded system execution speed will be lower because CPU clock will be adjusted
to keep the total power consumption in the
[TDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power) limit.
This test gives therefore the **single core peak performance**.

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is poor, the median of the 50% width is 9.05%,
    see section [time variation](#user-content-find-tvar).
- **Instruction timing relative to srv2 system**
  - the `Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3` based [srv3](hostinfo_srv3.md) system is a
    **factor 1.28 faster** than the `Xeon E5-2660 v2` based
    [srv2](hostinfo_srv2.md) system,
    based on the [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of
    119.06 to 92.86.
  - the srv2/srv3 instruction time ratio has a modest spread, see
    [srv2 vs srv3 timing comparison](#user-content-find-vs-srv3).

#### <a id="find-tvar">time variation</a>
The w50 width of time distributions is with 9.05% quite large compared to
most other tested systems. The test was done on an almost idle server, only
few other tasks were active. Even that quite small load caused apparently
a throttling of the CPU clock, leading to the observed width.

#### <a id="find-vs-srv2">srv2 vs srv3 timing comparison</a>
The [srv2 vs srv3](sum_2018-04-29_srv3_and_srv2.dat) instruction
timing listing shows the  absolute instruction times for srv3 and srv2
as well as the srv2/srv3 ratio, sorted by ascending ratio.

No obvious trend or systematic visible, except for
[STCK performance on srv2](2018-04-20_srv2#user-content-find-stck).
