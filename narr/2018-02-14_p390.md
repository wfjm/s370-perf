## Narrative: 2018-02-14_p390

**Objective**: First [P/390](sysinfo_p390.md) data with the new extended set
of tests. First s370_perf data from a _real_ CPU. The T900 tests were at this
time not yet integrated in s370_perf but handled by a separate code, the
results are therefore split in two files.

### Findings <a name="find"></a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is excellent, the median of the 50% width is 0.14%,
    the 50% width is for most tests 0.4% or better.
  - `TR` and `TRT` exhibit a large 50% width of about 15%, see
     [section TR and TRT time variation](#user-content-find-trw50)
     for data and discussion.
  - the `BCTR` instruction time depends on loop context and ranges from
    2 to 4 clock cycles. A value of 3 adopted to further analysis steps,
    see [section BCTR](#user-content-find-bctr).
  - the P/390 has 4-phase 70.125 MHz clock yielding a nominal instruction cycle
    time of 57.041 ns. From the data an effective cycle time of 57.135 ns
    can be deduced, within 1 permille of the nominal value, see
    [section clock calibration](#user-content-find-clock).
- **Instruction timing**
  - the RR type instructions have very well defined instruction time of
    integer multiples of the cycle time. For instructions with memory access
    the picture isn't as clean, see
    [section instruction cycle count](#user-content-find-cycle-cnt).
- **Instruction timing relative to rasp2b system**
  - the P/390 and Hercules on a Raspberry Pi 2B are in the same performance
    scale, so it's fair to compare them, see
    [section P/390 vs Raspberry Pi 2B](#user-content-find-p390-vs-rasp)

#### `TR` and `TRT` time variation <a name="find-trw50"></a>
`TR` and `TRT` show a w50 width of about 15%
(see [data](../data/2018-02-14_p390.dat#L103-L110)), in strong contrast to
all other instructions. A look at the individual measurements shows a
bi-modal distribution, the tpi values for T252, the `TR m,m (10c)` test. are
```
  tpi:  2327.341  2327.525  1877.202  1874.596  2327.329
  tpi:  1877.145  1877.247  1877.435  1877.151  1874.808
```

One gets either very close to 1877 ns or very close to 2327 ns. Since all
other tests show a narrow width this is very unlikely due a faulty measurement.
One possible explanation is that this is an interference between CPU state
and memory system state, and depending on pre-history one sees different
physical memory access patters and thus latencies.

#### `BCTR` loop offset calibration <a name="find-bctr"></a>

The analysis of the first P/390, see [2017-11-30_p390](2017-11-30_p390.md),
showed that a simple subtraction of the `BCTR` loop overhead did not result
in a fully consistent picture. The additional tests available now allow a
much more detailed analysis.

The tests `T900` to `T915` are simply a `BCTR` loop with a varying number
of `LR` instructions in loop body. See also
[T90x test documentation](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-t90x).
Inspecting the `n-cp` column of the
[raw data](../data/2018-02-14_p390-t900-raw.dat), which gives the time
in _major clock cycles_ for the whole test, shows that there is not a
simple linear relation. Assuming that an `LR` instruction takes one
major clock cycle the effective `BCTR` loop overhead can be deduced
```

    T100  LR R,R   (ig=100) :   103.25    103.0    3.0
```

The last column in the table above is the
_'execute and fetch next instruction'_
time for the `BCTR` instruction, and can be 2, 3 or 4 cycles depending on
context. The value of 3.5 seen for T900 might be a result of a having a 50-50%
mix of a 3 and 4 cycle execution time, depending on some internal state of the
CPU.

From this is obvious that
- subtracting a fixed value for all tests as `BCTR` loop overhead is probably
  not correct, the effective `BCTR` time depends on the state of the CPU which
  might depend on the instructions executed before and after.
- the `BCTR` time given by T311 for an empty loop is certainly a bad estimate,
  all non-empty loop cases above showed values between 3 and 4. If a single
  `BCTR` time is taken, it should be 3 rather than 2 major cycles.

#### Effective clock period calibration <a name="find-clock"></a>

An analysis using the nominal clock frequency gives `n-cp` values which are
always a bit higher than a integer value. This might indicate that the
effective major clock period is slightly longer than the nominal value
of 57.041 ns resulting from the 70.125 MHz nominal clock (and 4 phases).

The data is very precise, the `w50` column shows that the 50% width is
typically 0.5% or less. The data should therefore allow to determine an
effective clock period to about that precision.

Inspection of the [raw data](../data/2018-02-14_p390-raw.dat) of the
normal tests gives a handful of simple `RR` type instructions which have
a total loop time around 103 major cycles. They were used to determine
a clock period correction. The steps and results are summarized in the table

where the columns contain
- **raw**: measured time in ns for full loop, 100 instructions under test plus
  one `BCTR` instructions
- **w50**: 50% distribution width, the measurement uncertainty should be less
- **ns_nom**: number of major cycles using the nominal period of 57.041 ns
- **no**: number of major cycles assumed for `BCTR` loop overhead
- **p_eff**: the effective major period calculated using **no** as loop overhead
- **r_eff**: ratio of `p_eff / 57.041`
- **nc_cor**: number of major cycles using `p_eff`
- **res**: residue, the difference from calculated time with `no` and `p_eff`
  and the measured time `raw`
- **pull**: residue divided by uncertainty (here taken as `w50`)

Using for `no` a value of 3.5 for `AR`, `ALR`, `XR`, `OR` and `CR` and
3.0 of the rest is already suggested by the `raw` values, and is the only
way to achieve acceptable `pull` values.

The clock correction factor is finally calculated as a weighted average
of the `r_eff` values, resulting in 1.0016. The final result is
- effective major period:  57.135 ns
- effective clock frequency: 70.010 MHz

The final results are generated with this major period and an effective
`BCTR` time of 3.0 major clock cycles.

#### Instruction cycle count <a name="find-cycle-cnt"></a>

Inspecting the [data](../data/2018-02-14_p390.dat) gives very clean values
for `RR` type instructions, summarized in the following table which is sorted
by increasing `mcc` value

The column `mcc` gives the number of major cycles for this instruction,
and the small value for most `e-cp` values shows that the procedure is
self-consistent.

For instructions with memory access the picture isn't as nice, in many
cases the `n-cp` values differ significantly from integer values, some
cases are collected in the following table

The most plausible interpretation is that extra cycles are sometime needed
depending on the state of the CPU and the memory system, which in result
in non-integer average instruction timings.

#### P/390 vs Raspberry Pi comparison  <a name="find-p390-vs-rasp"></a>

The summary [P/390 vs rasp2b](sum_2018-02-14_rasp2b_and_p390.dat) shows a
comparison of P/390 with
[Hercules running on a Raspberry Pi 2B system](2018-01-03_rasp2b.md).
For most instructions the P/390 is slower, roughly by a factor of 1.5,
but some instructions show a large deviation from the average
behavior. The most notable cases are:
- `STCK` is very fast compared to Hercules, simply because on P/390 it's
  reading a hardware counter, while on Hercules it's a involves a system
  call to the host OS.
- instructions with memory interlock, like `TS`, `CS`, and `CDS` are very
  fast compared to Hercules. The P/390 is single processor, there is nothing
  to handle, while Hercules was run in a dual CPU configuration, where the
  emulation involves a mutex and in the _lock missed_ case a rather expensive
  `sched_yield()` system call.
- `CLCL` is about five times faster on P/390 than on Hercules for compare
  length of 100 and 250. Likely a result of the not very efficient
  implementation of `CLCL` in Hercules.
- memory intensive instructions, like `MVC` and especially `MVCL`,
  the P/390 is up to a factor of 10 slower, mostly likely because the P/390
  memory bandwidth is much less than that of a contemporary ARMv7 system.
