## Narrative: 2018-02-14_p390

First P/390 data with the new extended set of tests. The T900 tests were at
this time not yet integrated in s370_perf but handled by a separate code, the
results are therefore split in two files.

### Findings
#### `BCTR` loop offset calibration

The analysis of the first P/390, see [2017-11-30_p390](2017-11-30_p390.md),
showed that a simple subtraction of the `BCTR` loop overhead did not result
in a fully consistent picture. The additional tests available now allow a
much more detailed analysis.

The tests `T900` to `T915` are simply a `BCTR` loop with a varying number
of `LR` instructions in loop body. Inspecting the `n-cp` column of the
[raw data](../data/2018-02-14_p390-t900-raw.dat), which gives the time
in _major clock cycles_ for the whole test, shows that there is not a
simple linear relation. Assuming that an `LR` instruction takes one
major clock cycle the effective `BCTR` loop overhead can be deduced

```

The last column in the table above is the
_'execute and fetch next instruction'_
time for the `BCTR` instruction, and can be 2, 3 or 4 cycles depending on
context. The value of 3.5 seen for T900 might be a result of a having a 50-50%
mix of a 3 and 4 cycle execution time, depending on some internal state of the
CPU.

From this is obvious that
- subtracting a fixed value for all tests as `BCTR` loop overhead is probably
  not correct, the effective `BCTR` time depends on the state of the CPU which
  might depend on the instructions executed before and after.
- the `BCTR` time given by T311 for an empty loop is certainly a bad estimate,
  all non-empty loop cases above showed values between 3 and 4. If a single
  `BCTR` time is take, it should be 3 rather than 2 major cycles.

#### Effective clock period calibration

The `n-cp` values are always a bit higher than a integer value, which might
indicate that the major clock period is slightly longer than the nominal value
of 57.041 ns resulting from the 70.125 MHz nominal clock (and 4 phases).

The data is very precise, the `w50` column shows that the 50% width is
typically 0.5% or less. The data should therefore allow to determine an
effective clock period to about that precision.

Inspection of the [raw data](../data/2018-02-14_p390-raw.dat) of the
normal tests gives a handful of simple `RR` type instructions which have
a total loop time around 103 major cycles. They were used to determine
a clock period correction. The steps and results are summarized in the table

where the columns contain
- **raw**: measured time in ns for full loop, 100 instructions under test plus
  one `BCTR` instructions
- **w50**: 50% distribution width, the measurement uncertainty should be less
- **ns_nom**: number of major cycles using the nominal period of 57.041 ns
- **no**: number of major cycles assumed for `BCTR` loop overhead
- **p_eff**: the effective major period calculated using **no** as loop overhead
- **r_eff**: ratio of `p_eff / 57.041`
- **nc_cor**: number of major cycles using `p_eff`
- **res**: residue, the difference from calculated time with `no` and `p_eff`
  and the measured time `raw`
- **pull**: residue divided by uncertainty (here taken as `w50`)

Using for `no` a value of 3.5 for `AR`, `ALR`, `XR`, `OR` and `CR` and
3.0 of the rest is already suggested by the `raw` values, and is the only
way to achieve acceptable `pull` values.

The clock correction factor is finally calculated as a weighted average
of the `r_eff` values, resulting in 1.0016. The final result is
- effective major period:  57.135 ns
- effective clock frequency: 70.010 MHz

The final results are generated with this major period and an effective
`BCTR` time of 3.0 major clock cycles.

The column `mcc` gives the number of major cycles for this instruction,
and the small value for most `e-cp` values shows that the procedure is
self-consistent.

For instructions with memory access the picture isn't as nice, in many
cases the `n-cp` values differ significantly from integer values, some
cases are collected in the following table

The most plausible interpretation is that extra cycles are sometime needed
depending on the state of the CPU and the memory system, which in result
in non-integer average instruction timings.

#### P/390 vs Raspberry Pi comparison

The summary [P/390 vs rasp2b](sum_2018-02-14_rasp2b_and_p390.dat) shows a
comparison of P/390 with
[Hercules running on a Raspberry Pi 2B system](2018-01-03_rasp2b.md).
For most instructions the P/390 is slower, roughly by a factor of 1.5.
For memory intensive instructions, like `MVC` and especially `MVCL`,
the P/390 is up to a factor of 10 slower, mostly likely because the
P/390 memory bandwidth is much less than that of a contemporary ARMv7
system.
