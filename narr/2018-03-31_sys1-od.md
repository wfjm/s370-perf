## Narrative: 2018-03-31_sys1-od

**Objective**: obtain data on an `Intel Core2 Duo E8400` based system,
use Hercules binary from `tk4- 09 rc2`, slightly different than on most
other systems. Use system default cpufreq governor _ondemand_.
To be compared with [2018-03-31_sys1-3g](2018-03-31_sys1-3g.md).

### Findings <a name="find"></a>

#### Performance issues with _ondemand_ governor  <a name="find-cpufreq"></a>
Running [sys1](hostinfo_sys1.md) with the default
[cpufreq](README_narr.md#user-content-cpufreq) governor _'ondemand'_
results in a large variance of the test timings, with w50 values of around 20%
and up to 50%. This is in strong contrast to operation with a fixed CPU clock
of 3 GHz, see [sys1-3g case](2018-03-31_sys1-3g.md) where the w50 values are
for most tests below 1%.
The [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) rating is also reduced,
70.92 MIPS for _ondemand_ in contrast to 77.40 MIPS for _3 GHz fixed_.

The Linux kernel is with 4.4.0 reasonably up-to-date, but the cpufreq sub-system
of this kernel is apparently not well tuned for the `Intel Core2 Duo E8400`
(vintage 2008) used in [sys1](hostinfo_sys1.md). The update latency is
reported as 160 us, but apparently the updates are too slow and don't
follow fast enough when the main CPU worker thread is re-scheduled on
another core (there are only two!).

All benchmark runs on [sys1](hostinfo_sys1.md) are therefore done with a
fixed CPU frequency setting of 3 GHz.
