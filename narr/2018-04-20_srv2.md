## Narrative: 2018-04-20_srv2

**Objective**: obtain data on an `Intel Xeon E5-2660 v2` based system.
To be compared with [2018-04-29_srv3](2018-04-29_srv3.md).

**Proviso**: the benchmark was run on an almost idle server. On a fully
loaded system execution speed will be lower because CPU clock will be adjusted
to keep the total power consumption in the
[TDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power) limit.
This test gives therefore the **single core peak performance**.

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is poor, the median of the 50% width is 5.10%,
    see section [time variation](#user-content-find-tvar).
- **Instruction timing**
  - see [2018-04-29_srv3](2018-04-29_srv3.md##user-content-find) for a
    comparison with a `Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3` based system.
  - `STCK` is very slow, see section
    [STCK performance](#user-content-find-stck).

#### <a id="find-tvar">time variation</a>
The w50 width of time distributions is with 5.10% quite large compared to
most other tested systems. The test was done on an almost idle server, only
few other tasks were active. Even that quite small load caused apparently
a throttling of the CPU clock, leading to the observed width.

#### <a id="find-stck">STCK performance</a>
The instruction time of `STCK` is with 794 ns very large when compared to
other comparable systems running _native Linux_

| Case Id | System | CPU | STCK timing |
| ------- | ------ | --- | ----------: |
| [2018-03-31_sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md)       | [sys2](hostinfo_sys2.md) | Intel Xeon E5-1620    | 65.48 ns |
| _this case_                                 | [srv2](hostinfo_srv2.md) | Intel Xeon E5-2660 v2 | 794.00 ns |
| [2018-04-29_srv3](2018-04-29_srv3.md)       | [srv3](hostinfo_srv3.md) | Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3 | 69.54 ns |
| [2018-04-28_srv4](2018-04-28_srv4.md)       | [srv4](hostinfo_srv4.md) | Intel Xeon E5-2680 v4 | 66.32 ns |
| [2018-04-07_srv1-pf](2018-04-07_srv1-pf.md) | [srv1](hostinfo_srv1.md) | AMD Opteron 6238      | 171.08 ns |
| [2018-04-27_srv5-a](2018-04-27_srv5-a.md)   | [srv5](hostinfo_srv5.md) | AMD EPYC 7551         | 92.00 ns |

The `STCK` test shows also with 12.65% the largest time variance of all
Txxx tests. The cause of this behavior is not understood.
