## Narrative: 2018-04-30_rasp2b-1cpu

**Objective**: obtain, on an `ARMv7` based system,
data with a single CPU configuration to test the impact
of SMP overhead in the normally used dual CPU configuration.
To be compared with [2018-04-02_rasp2b](2018-04-02_rasp2b.md).

### Findings <a name="find"></a>

- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is very good, the median of the 50% width is 0.55%.
  - `MVCL` tests have a high run time variation, see section
    [MVCL time variation](#user-content-find-mvcl-tvar).
- **Instruction timing relative to dual CPU system**
  - the 2cpu and 1cpu have, as expected, essentially identical instruction
    times, see see ratio sorted
    [1cpu vs 2cpu](sum_2018-04-30_rasp2b_2cpu_and_1cpu.dat) instruction
    timing listing, with the exceptions of instructions with memory interlock
    and `MVCL`.
  - `MVCL` is a bit slower, but shows also a large run time variation,
    see section [MVCL time variation](#user-content-find-mvcl-tvar).
  - instructions with memory interlock are much faster,
    see section [CS+TS performance](#user-content-find-cs-ts).

#### MVCL time variation <a name="find-mvcl-tvar"></a>
The 1k and 4k `MVCL` tests exhibit, like in
[the 2cpu case](2018-04-02_rasp2b.md#user-content-find-mvcl-tvar),
a large time variation. They are also a bit slower for 1cpu, but this is
most likely an artifact caused by the large time variation.

#### CS+TS performance <a name="find-cs-ts"></a>
The `CS`, `CDS` and `TS` instructions, which involve interlocked memory
accesses, run much faster in a single CPU system

```

The _lock taken_ cases are roughly a factor 3 faster.
The _lock missed_ cases are roughly a factor 12 faster, simply because
a `sched_yield()` system call is done in the SMP case but not in the
single CPU case. Very similar ratios are observed for on other systems,
e.g. [sys2](2018-03-31_sys2-1cpu.md#user-content-find-cs-ts).
