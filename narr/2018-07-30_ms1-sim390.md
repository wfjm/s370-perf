## Narrative: 2018-07-30_ms1-sim390

**Objective**: obtain data with the
[Sim390](http://www.canpub.com/teammpg/de/sim390/) emulator on an
`AMD A6-5200` based system. 
To be compared with Hercules 4.0 data [2018-07-30_ms1-herc40](2018-07-30_ms1-herc40.md).

**Note**: The operating system running on the emulator is
[MUSIC/SP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC/SP) and not MVS 3.8J as
for the majority of the `s370_perf` data. This difference should have no
sizeable impact on the measured instruction timings since `SVC` and
privileged instructions, which depend on system response times, aren't covered.

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is moderate, the median of the 50% width is 1.8%.
- **Instruction timing of Sim390 compared to Hercules 4.0**
  - Sim390 is, on identical Host hardware, a factor is a **factor 6.5 slower**
    than Hercules 4.0,
    based on the [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of
    6.39 to 41.54.
  - the sim390/herc40 instruction time ratio has a very large spread, see
    [sim390 vs herc40 timing comparison](sum_2018-07-30_ms1_herc40_and_sim390.dat).
  - simple instructions, like `LR R,R`, are about a factor 9 slower,
    see [LR timing](#user-content-find-lr).
  - decimal arithmetic is a bit faster,
    see section [decimal performance](#user-content-find-dec).
  - `CLCL` and `TRT` are much faster,
    see section [CLCL+TRT performance](#user-content-find-clcl-trt).
  - `STCK` is a about a factor two faster,
    see section [STCK performance](#user-content-find-stck).

This indicates that Hercules has a much more efficient handling of
instruction fetch and decoding. This explains most of the large observed
spread of instruction time ratios, since _simple_ instructions are
much more affected than _complex_ instructions.

#### <a id="find-dec">Decimal arithmetic performance</a>
Decimal arithmetic is a bit faster

This might indicate that Sim390 has a more efficient decimal arithmetic
package. However, a firm statement is only possible when several host CPUs have
been tested.

#### <a id="find-clcl-trt">CLCL+TRT performance</a>
`CLCL` and `TRT` are much faster

Hercules is notoriously slow for `CLCL` and `TRT` instructions when compared
with `CLC` (see [CLCL vs CLC on sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-clcl))
and `TR` (see [TRT vs TR on sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-trt)).
Sim390 apparently does a much better job for these two instructions.

#### <a id="find-stck">STCK performance</a>
`STCK` is significantly faster, about a factor two
```
Tag   Comment                :    herc40    sim390 :  sim/herc
T600  STCK m                 :    493.25    213.13 :    0.432
```
Comes a bit as a surprise, because this instruction time essentially benchmarks
the speed of the system call used to retrieve the system time.
Apparently uses Sim390 a faster method to retrieve the system time than Hercules.
