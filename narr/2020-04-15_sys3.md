## Narrative: 2020-04-15_sys

**Objective**: obtain data on a `NUC8I3BEH` based system.
To be compared with [2018-03-31_sys2](2018-03-31_sys2.md).

### <a id="find">Findings</a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is excellent, the median of the 50% width is 0.13%.
- **Instruction timing relative to rasp2b system**
  - the `Core i3-8109U` based [sys3](hostinfo_sys3.md) system is a
    **factor 1.27 faster** than the `XEON E5-1620` based
    [sys2](hostinfo_sys2.md) reference system,
    based on the [lmark](README_narr.md#user-content-lmark) MIPS ratio of
    145.52 to 114.56. The higher effective CPU clock is 3.6 GHz in both cases,
    the speed up is apparently mostly due to the more efficient
    microarchitecture (Coffee Lake (8th Gen) vs Sandy Bridge (2nd Gen)). 
  - the sys2/sys3 instruction time ratio has a very large spread, see
    [sys2 vs sys3 timing comparison](#user-content-find-vs-sys2).

#### <a id="find-vs-sys2">sys2 vs sys3 timing comparison</a>
The [sys2 vs sys3](sum_2020-04-18_sys3_and_sys2.dat) instruction
timing listing shows the absolute instruction times for sys3 and sys2
as well as the sys2/sys3 ratio, sorted by ascending ratio.

The instruction time ratio varies from 0.62 to 1.86 with no obvious
systematics, with two exception
- `CS`, `CDS` and `TS` are significantly slower. A bit surprising, but
  potentially yet another fall-out of the very processor specific
  mitigation measures against
  [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability))
  and
  [Spectre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability))
  vulnerabilities.
  See  [blog entry](https://wfjm.github.io/blogs/mvs/2018-01-14-impact-of-meltdown-on-hercules.html) for some background.
- `MVCL` is significantly faster.
