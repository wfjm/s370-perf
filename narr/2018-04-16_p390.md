### Findings <a name="find"></a>
- **General**
  - the test reproducibility is excellent, the median of the 50% width is 0.28%,
    the 50% width is for most tests 0.5% or better.
  - this data agrees very well with the [2018-02-14](2018-02-14_p390.md)
    data, see section
    [2018-02-14 vs 2018-04-16 data](#user-content-find-last)
  - `TR` and `TRT` do not exhibit a large 50% width anymore, see
     [section TR and TRT time variation](#user-content-find-trw50).
  - the `BCTR` instruction time depends on loop context and ranges from
    2 to 4 clock cycles. A value of 3 adopted to further analysis steps,
    see [section BCTR](#user-content-find-bctr).
  - the P/390 has 4-phase 70.125 MHz clock yielding a nominal instruction cycle
    time of 57.041 ns. From the data an effective cycle time of 57.158 ns
    can be deduced, within 2 permille of the nominal value, see
    [section clock calibration](#user-content-find-clock).
- **Instruction timing**
  - the RR type instructions have very well defined instruction time of
    integer multiples of the cycle time. For instructions with memory access
    the picture isn't as clean, see
    [section instruction cycle count](#user-content-find-cycle-cnt).
  - unaligned memory access requires 1-4 additional cycles, see
    [section unaligned access](#user-content-find-unal).
  - many basic instructions execute in a single cycle, see
    [section single cycle](#user-content-find-cycle-1cyc).
  - `LNR` and `LPR` use 2 cycles, see
    [section LNR+LPR timing](#user-content-find-cycle-lnr).
  - `LER` and `LDR` use 2 cycles, see
    [section LER+LDR timing](#user-content-find-cycle-ler).
  - `LPER`,`LPDR` etc uses 4 cycles, a bit astonishing, see
    [section LPER timing](#user-content-find-cycle-lper).
  - reasonable floating point performance, `ADR` and `AER` in 6 cycles, see
    [section floating arithmetic](#user-content-find-float).
  - MVC is very efficient, including byte propagation, see
    section [MVC performance](#user-content-find-mvc).
  - `MVCIN` is a factor 3 slower than `MVN` or `MVZ`,
    see section [MVCIN performance](#user-content-find-mvcin).
  - `MVCL` has same copy speed as `MVC`,
    see section [MVCL performance](#user-content-find-mvcl).
  - `CLC` is very efficient, processes 4 bytes/cycle,
    see section [CLC performance](#user-content-find-clc).
  - test `T272` for `CLC` shows **unexpected behavior**,
    see section [CLC T272 issue](#user-content-find-clc-t272).
  - `CLCL` is a factor of 2 slower than `CLC`,
    see section [CLCL performance](#user-content-find-clcl).
  - `TRT` has same performance as `TR`, about 2.5 cycles/byte,
    see section [TRT+TR performance](#user-content-find-trt).
  - speed of decimal arithmetic is almost independent of digit count,
    except for `DP`,
    see section [decimal performance](#user-content-find-dec).
- **Instruction timing comparisons**
  - [S/360-70 vs P/390](#user-content-find-vs-s360-70) -
    compare with `System/360 Model 70` _paper performance_.
  - [sys2 vs P/390](#user-content-find-vs-sys2) -
    compare with Hercules on `Intel Xeon E5-1620`.

#### 2018-02-14 vs 2018-04-16 data <a name="find-last"></a>
Most instruction times agree to better than 0.5%, see
[ratio sorted data comparison](sum_2018-04-16_p390_and_2018-02-14.dat).
The largest deviations are 3%, the cases which deviate by more than 0.5% are

All [T9** auxiliary test](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-taux) times
agree to better than 0.5%.

#### `TR` and `TRT` time variation <a name="find-trw50"></a>
Data taken on [2018-02-14](2018-02-14_p390.md) showed a large w50 width of
about 15%, see
[section in narrative](2018-02-14_p390.md#user-content-find-trw50).
This is not observed again, see
[data](../data/2018-04-16_p390.dat#L128-L135),
the w50 values for `TR` and `TRT` are very similar to other tests.

#### `BCTR` loop offset calibration <a name="find-bctr"></a>
The analysis of the
[2018-02-14 P/390 data](2018-02-14_p390.md#user-content-find-bctr)
showed that a simple subtraction of the `BCTR` loop overhead did not result
in a fully consistent picture. This analysis was repeated with the current data.

The tests `T900` to `T915` are simply a `BCTR` loop with a varying number
of `LR` instructions in loop body. See also
[T90x test documentation](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-t90x).
Inspecting the `n-cp` column of the
[raw data](../data/2018-04-16_p390-raw.dat), which gives the time
in _major clock cycles_ for the whole test, shows that there is not a
simple linear relation. Assuming that an `LR` instruction takes one
major clock cycle the effective `BCTR` loop overhead can be deduced

    T100  LR R,R (ig=100)   :   103.01    103.0    3.0
```
The last column in the table above is the
_'execute and fetch next instruction'_
time for the `BCTR` instruction, and can be 2, 3 or 4 cycles depending on
context. The value of 3.5 seen for T900 might be a result of a having a 50-50%
mix of a 3 and 4 cycle execution time, depending on some internal state of the
CPU.

From this is obvious that
- subtracting a fixed value for all tests as `BCTR` loop overhead is probably
  not correct, the effective `BCTR` time depends on the state of the CPU which
  might depend on the instructions executed before and after.
- the `BCTR` time given by T311 for an empty loop is certainly a bad estimate,
  all non-empty loop cases above showed values between 3 and 4. If a single
  `BCTR` time is taken, it should be 3 rather than 2 major cycles.

The results are in full agreement to the
[2018-02-14 BCTR calibration](2018-02-14_p390.md#user-content-find-bctr).

#### Effective clock period calibration <a name="find-clock"></a>
An analysis using the nominal clock frequency gives `n-cp` values which are
always a bit higher than a integer value. This might indicate that the
effective major clock period is slightly longer than the nominal value
of 57.041 ns resulting from the 70.125 MHz nominal clock (and 4 phases).

The data is very precise, the `w50` column shows that the 50% width is
typically 0.5% or less. The data should therefore allow to determine an
effective clock period to about that precision.

Inspection of the [raw data](../data/2018-04-16_p390-raw.dat) of the
normal tests gives a handful of simple `RR` type instructions which have
a total loop time around 103 major cycles. They were used to determine
a clock period correction. The steps and results are summarized in the table

where the columns contain
- **raw**: measured time in ns for full loop, 100 instructions under test plus
  one `BCTR` instructions
- **w50**: 50% distribution width, the measurement uncertainty should be less
- **ns_nom**: number of major cycles using the nominal period of 57.041 ns
- **no**: number of major cycles assumed for `BCTR` loop overhead
- **p_eff**: the effective major period calculated using **no** as loop overhead
- **r_eff**: ratio of `p_eff / 57.041`
- **nc_cor**: number of major cycles using `p_eff`
- **res**: residue, the difference from calculated time with `no` and `p_eff`
  and the measured time `raw`
- **pull**: residue divided by uncertainty (here taken as `w50`)

In contrast to the
[analysis of the 2018-02-14 data](2018-02-14_p390.md#user-content-find-clock)
consistent results are achieved with a `no` a value of 3.0 for all cases.

The clock correction factor is finally calculated as a weighted average
of the `r_eff` values, resulting in 1.0020. The final result is
- effective major period:  57.158 ns
- effective clock frequency: 69.982 MHz

The final results are generated with this major period and an effective
`BCTR` time of 3.0 major clock cycles.

Notes:
- this is good agreement with the
  [2018-02-14 data analysis](2018-02-14_p390.md#user-content-find-clock),
  the clock correct changed from 1.0016 to 1.0020.
- s370_perf uses, at this point, the elapsed time and not the CPU time to
  measure times. Job unrelated MVS system overhead will therefore increase
  the measured time, which is translated in the current analysis into a
  slower effective clock. The ratio of CPU to elapsed time is 99.73%, which
  is quite consistent with the observed clock correction of 1.0020.

#### Instruction cycle count <a name="find-cycle-cnt"></a>
The instruction times are available in three views
- [2018-04-16_p390.dat](../data/2018-04-16_p390.dat) - _sorted by tag name_
- [2018-04-16_p390-ins.dat](../data/2018-04-16_p390-ins.dat) - _sorted by instruction_
- [2018-04-16_p390-mcc.dat](../data/2018-04-16_p390-mcc.dat) - _sorted by cycle count_

with three additional columns
- **n-cp**: number of clock cycles, calculated dividing the instruction
  time shown in the `tpi` column by the effective clock period
  (57.158 ns, see [clock calibration](#user-content-find-clock)).
- **e-cp**: shows how much `n-cp` deviates from an integer value,
  given in percent of the clock period.
- **mcc**: the `n-cp` value rounded to the nearest integer.

Inspecting the [data](../data/2018-04-16_p390.dat) gives very clean values
for `RR` type instructions, summarized in the following table which is sorted
by increasing `mcc` value

For instructions with memory access the picture isn't as nice, in many
cases the `n-cp` values differ significantly from integer values, some
cases are collected in the following table

The most plausible interpretation is that extra cycles are sometime needed
depending on the state of the CPU and the memory system, which in result
in non-integer average instruction timings.

### Unaligned memory access <a name="find-unal"></a>
s370_perf has several tests addressing unaligned memory access
([see docu](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-unal)),
which can be summarized as
```
  T102  L R,m    : 174.70 ns | T103  L R,m (unal)     : 232.75 ns -> dt =  58.05 ns  1.0 ncp

  T538  STD R,m  : 241.24 ns | T539  STD R,m (unal)   : 465.50 ns -> dt = 224.26 ns  3.9 ncp
```
and condensed to the findings
- unaligned integer loads cost one cycle
- unaligned integer stores cost three cycles
- unaligned float loads cost two cycles  (both single and double precision)
- unaligned float stores cost four cycles

#### Singe Cycle Instructions <a name="find-cycle-1cyc"></a>
Many basic instructions execute in a single cycle
- basic integer RR: `ALR`,`AR`,`CLR`,`CR`,`LCR`,`LR`,`LTR`,`NR`,`OR`,`SLR`,`SR`, and `XR`
- load address: `LA R,n`
- fall through branch: `BCR 0,0`, `BCTR R,0` and `BNZ l (no br)`

#### LNR+LPR timing <a name="find-cycle-lnr"></a>
In contrast to load complement `LCR`, which executes in a single cycle,
require the integer load positive `LPR` and load negative `LNR` instructions
two cycles. This indicates that they are implemented as a conditional
complement, where the evaluation of the condition and the complementing
require one cycle each.

#### LER+LDR timing <a name="find-cycle-ler"></a>
The floating loads require two cycles, for short and double floats. The
P/390 has 64 bit internal data paths, double floats and single floats have
therefore same timing.

#### LPER timing <a name="find-cycle-lper"></a>
The load complement, negative, positive, test type float instructions,
`LCER`,`LNER`,`LPER`,`LTER`,`LCDR`,`LNDR`,`LPDR`,and `LTDR`, 
execute in 4 cycles. A bit astonishing, the sign handling is trivial
for floating point, just flip, clear, set or test the sign bit. Why
load test takes 4 cycles is difficult to understand, the integer `LTR`
executes in a single cycle.

#### Floating Arithmetic <a name="find-float"></a>
Floating point performance is reasonable. Addition, subtraction and compare
execute in 6 cycles for single and double precision floats. Multiply and divide
take longer for double operands.

#### MVC performance <a name="find-mvc"></a>
The [T15x](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-mvc) tests examine `MVC` over
a wide range of conditions
```
  Tag   Test                        tpi      n-cp  byte/cyc    dest buff comment
  T150  MVC m,m (5c)             555.61      9.72    0.51
  T151  MVC m,m (10c)            727.69     12.73    0.79
  T152  MVC m,m (15c)            840.48     14.70    1.02
  T153  MVC m,m (30c)           1243.19     21.75    1.38
  T154  MVC m,m (100c)          3219.37     56.32    1.78
  T155  MVC m,m (250c)          7698.33    134.69    1.86
  T156  MVC m,m (250c,over1)    2432.15     42.55    5.87      offset by + 1 byte
  T157  MVC m,m (250c,over2)    4012.62     70.20    3.56      offset by -24 byte
```
`MVC` costs about 8 cycles to setup, than
- copies data with 2 bytes/cycle when buffers are _not word aligned_
- copies data with 4 bytes/cycle when buffers are _word aligned_ (see `T157`)
- does _character propagation_ with 8 byte/cycle (see `T156`)

#### MVCIN performance <a name="find-mvcin"></a>
The inverse copy `MVCIN` is naturally slower than `MVC`, because it must be
handled _byte-by-byte_. The instruction times in cycles (`n-cp`) are
```
            MVC      MVN      MVZ    MVCIN
   10c    12.73    18.73    18.73    33.50 
   30c    21.75    34.92    34.91    94.85
  100c    56.32                     308.48
```
All 4 instructions seem to have a setup of about 8 cycles. `MVN` and `MVZ`
process data with 1 cycle/byte, while `MVCIN` requires 3 cycles/byte.

#### MVCL performance <a name="find-mvcl"></a>
`MVC` copies word aligned buffers with 4 byte/cycle, see `T155` and
section [MVC performance](#user-content-find-mvc).
`MVCL` reaches the same copy speed of 4 byte/cycle, see `D174` where a
4 kByte copy takes 1069.38 cycles.

#### CLC performance <a name="find-clc"></a>
The [T27x](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-clc) tests examine `CLC` over
a wide range of conditions. The `eq` tests compare two equal strings, so the
instruction must read all bytes of _both_ buffers.
```
Tag   Test                         tpi     n-cp
T270  CLC m,m (10c,eq)          524.35     9.17
T271  CLC m,m (10c,ne)          349.81     6.12
T272  CLC m,m (30c,eq)          349.57     6.12   <-- strange !!
T273  CLC m,m (30c,ne)          350.09     6.13
T274  CLC m,m (100c,eq)        1748.91    30.60
T275  CLC m,m (100c,ne)         353.81     6.19
T276  CLC m,m (250c,eq)        3982.77    69.68
T277  CLC m,m (250c,ne)         353.80     6.19
```
The setup overhead is about 4 cycles, than `CLC` processes 4 byte/cycle from
both buffers.
For `T272` behavior see [next section](#user-content-find-clc-t272).

`CLC`, used with _half-word aligned_ operands, has the same speed as `MVC`,
used with _word aligned_ operands
```
Tag   Test                         tpi     n-cp
T276  CLC m,m (250c,eq)        3982.77    69.68
T157  MVC m,m (250c,over2)    4012.62     70.20
```
The memory interface is apparently very efficient.

#### CLC T272 Issue <a name="find-clc-t272"></a>

**Very odd** is the behavior of `T272`, the `CLC (30c,eq)` case. The two strings
to compare are definitively equal, see
[source code](https://github.com/wfjm/s370-perf/blob/2685ff0/codes/s370_perf.asm#L2849-L2858), but the timing is the same as for `T273`, the `CLC (30c,ne)` case,
see table in [previous section](#user-content-find-clc).
Currently there is no explanation for this **unexpected behavior**.

#### CLCL performance <a name="find-clcl"></a>
The [T28x](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-clcl) tests examine `CLCL`
over a wide range of conditions. The
[D28x lines](../data/2018-04-16_p390.dat#L340-L343)
give the pure `CLCL` instruction times which can be compared with `CLC`.
The instruction times in cycles (`n-cp`) are
```
D281  CLCL (4kb,10b)    :   27.26  | T270  CLC m,m (10c,eq)  :    9.17
D282  CLCL (4kb,100b)   :   71.09  | T274  CLC m,m (100c,eq) :   30.60
D283  CLCL (4kb,250b)   :  149.86  | T276  CLC m,m (250c,eq) :   69.68
```
`CLCL` processes only 2 byte/cycle, even both buffers are word aligned,
while `CLC` processes 4 bytes/cycle, even when buffers are not word aligned.

#### TRT+TR performance <a name="find-trt"></a>
`TRT` has the same performance as `TR`, about 2.5 cycles per byte.
The instruction times in cycles (`n-cp`) are
```
  T252  TR m,m (10c)    :   32.75  | T255  TRT m,m (10c,zero)  :   30.59
  T253  TR m,m (100c)   :  267.17  | T256  TRT m,m (100c,zero) :  258.80
  T254  TR m,m (250c)   :  646.39  | T257  TRT m,m (250c,zero) :  642.26
```

#### Decimal arithmetic performance <a name="find-dec"></a>
The [T42x](../doc/s370_perf.md#user-content-tests-packed) tests examine
decimal packed arithmetic for 10 and 30 digit numbers.
The timing for
`AP`, `SP`, and `MP` exhibit a weak increase of instruction time with digit
count, only `DP` is significantly faster for shorter numbers.
The instruction times in cycles (`n-cp`) are
```
              10d       30d
  AP m,m    44.06     50.65
  SP m,m    42.70     50.65
  MP m,m   100.69    104.87
  DP m,m   243.64    798.72
```

#### s360-70 vs p390 timing comparison  <a name="find-vs-s360-70"></a>
The _measured_ timing for the P/390 can be compared with the
_paper performance_ of the announced but never shipped `IBM System/360 Model 70`
(see [narrative](1964-05-01_s360-70.md)). For the P/390 it is very
convenient to discuss timing in terms of _CPU cycles_, see
[section cycle count](#user-content-find-cycle-cnt).
For the S/360-70 the cycle time is not specified, and also not obvious from the
systematics of instruction times, see
[section s360-70 cycle time](1964-05-01_s360-70.md#user-content-find-cycle-time).
For the purpose of this comparison the S/360-70 cycle time is assumed to
be the time of a `LR R,R` instruction, thus 400 ns.
Two tables are available
- [by absolute instruction time](sum_2018-04-16_p390_and_s360-70.dat)
- [by `LR R,R` normalized time](sum_2018-04-16_p390_and_s360-70-nrr.dat)

Both are sorted by timing ratio. The `LR R,R` normalized version is very
convenient for the study of relative performance differences.
Main observations are
- `LTER` and friends take 4 cycles on P/390, only 1 cycle on S/360-70.
- floating division takes on S/360-70 about a quarter of the number of cycles.
- decimal packed arithmetic instruction require much less cycles on S/360-70.
- `XR`,`NR` and `OR` take 1.5 cycles on S/360-70, only one on  P/390.
- `LA R,m` takes 2.7 cycles on S/360-70, only one on  P/390.

#### Hercules on sys2 vs p390 timing comparison  <a name="find-vs-sys2"></a>
One way to do a _real CPU vs Hercules_ comparison is to contrast the key
findings for the [tk4-](http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/) version of Hercules on
the reference system [sys2](hostinfo_sys2.md),
see [sys2 findings](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find), with the key
findings for the P/390, see section [findings](#user-content-find):
- **MVCIN**: `MVCIN` is a factor 3 slower than `MVN` and `MVZ` on P/390,
  see [p390 MVCIN finding](#user-content-find-mvcin),
  while on Hercules the factor is about 6, see
  [sys2 MVCIN finding](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-mvcin).
- **MVCL**: `MVCL` and `MVC` have similar speed on P/390, see
  [p390 MVCL finding](#user-content-find-mvcl), and Hercules, see
  [sys2 MVCL finding](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-mvcl).
- **CLC**: `CLC` has same speed as `MVC` on P/390, see
  [p390 CLC finding](#user-content-find-clc),
  while on Hercules `CLC` is a factor of about 5 slower than `MVC`, see
  [sys2 CLC finding](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-clc).
- **CLCL**: `CLCL` is a factor of 2 slower than `CLC` on P/390, see
  [p390 CLCL finding](#user-content-find-clcl),
  while on Hercules `CLCL` is a factor 12 slower than `CLC`, see
  [sys2 CLCL finding](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-clcl).
- **TRT**: `TRT` has the same performance as `TR` on P/390, see
  [p390 TRT finding](#user-content-find-trt),
  while on Hercules `TRT` is a factor of 12 slower than `TR`, see
  [sys2 TRT finding](2018-03-31_sys2.md#user-content-find-trt).

A second approach for a P/390 vs Hercules assessment is to compare the
instruction times. Again, the `LR R,R` normalized times are more convenient
for the study of relative performance differences, see
[sys2 vs P/390 time](sum_2018-04-16_p390_and_sys2-1cpu-nrr.dat).

Hercules is much faster for storage intensive instructions, like `MVCL`, simply
because the speed of the underlying host system dominates, which is of course
more powerful than a vintage 1994 P/390 implemented in 600 nm technology.

At the other end of the speed ratio distribution are instructions
which have an implementation in Hercules slow compared to P/390
```
T272  CLC m,m (30c,eq)       :      6.12     21.85 :    3.570
T156  MVC m,m (250c,over1)   :     42.55    169.29 :    3.979

```
- the byte propagation case of `MVC` is apparently optimized on P/390
  and not in Hercules.
- `CLC` is amazingly fast on P/390, in Hercules just on par with `XC`.
- `CLCL` is by all standards simply slow in Hercules.
- `STCK`, last but not least, is naturally slow on a simulator because
  a system call is needed to obtain the current time, while on a real
  CPU simply an internal machine register read.
